<p>This document summarizes the procedures Creative Code Berlin uses to
enforce the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Why have a grievance policy?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><blockquote>
<p>The purpose for having a policy is to make dealing with grievances,
when they happen, easier for the committee. Easier as in, less thinking
and decision-making about what is the right thing to do. The grievance
policy provides the process to follow, and suggestions for how to make
decisions along that path.</p>

<p>This is also recommended in the book ["How to Respond to Code of
Conduct Reports"](<a
href="https://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/books/cocguide.pdf"><em>https://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/books/cocguide.pdf</em></a>)
by Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner. The relevant quote in Chapter 2
page 23:</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>'If possible, adopt a written incident response guide to guide your
work, such as the one in the "Responding to a report" chapter of this
book. When first receiving a report, often the committee members are
stressed and not capable of thinking well. Even when calm, people often
forget important steps of a process. A written guide provides a
framework and a set of reminders to work through during a stressful
time.'</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Summary of processes</strong></p>
<p>When the committee receives a report of a possible Code of Conduct
violation, it will:</p>
<p>1. Document the report in written form.</p>
<p>2. Acknowledge the receipt of the report.</p>
<p>3. Evaluate conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>4. Call a meeting of the grievance work group. (Committee members
without a conflict of interest are the members of the grievance work
group.)</p>
<p>5. Review the report.</p>
<p>6. Propose expected change of behavior.</p>
<p>7. Propose consequences for the reported behavior.</p>
<p>8. Vote on suggested changes and consequences for the reported
person(s).</p>
<p>9. Follow up with the reported person(s).</p>
<p>10. Process any responses from reported person(s).</p>
<p>11. Follow up with the reporter.</p>
<p>12. Release a public report if the incident was public</p>
<p>1. Document the report in written form</p>
<p>If someone reports a grievance, ask them for a written account of
what happened. If the report is verbal, then the member of the committee
who received the report should write down as soon as possible what they
were told.</p>
<p>If the following information is not volunteered in the written or
verbal report, ask for it, and include it, and inform them that this is
voluntary.</p>
<p>* Who the reported person(s) is(are)</p>
<p>* The behavior they would like to report</p>
<p>* The approximate time of the behavior</p>
<p>* The circumstances surrounding the incident</p>
<p>* Other people involved in the incident</p>
<p>* Any supporting information (screenshots, etc.)</p>
<p>Tell the reporter that "If you're ok with it, I am going to convey
this incident to the organisers." Pause, and see if they say they do not
want this; if this is the case, the report is not processed further.
Otherwise, it proceeds.</p>
<p>Communicate the incident to the CCB committee.</p>
<p>As soon as possible, communicate with the reported person(s) to let
them know that there is a complaint about them. Let them tell a member
of the CCB committee their side of the story. The grievance work group
will review this in their meeting.</p>
<p>2. Acknowledge the receipt of the report</p>
<p>Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgment of the receipt of
their report within 72 hours.</p>
<p>3. Evaluate conflicts of interest</p>
<p>There is a conflict of interest if the individual does not think they
can be impartial to either the reporter or reported party.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>- The reporter or reported person has a formal or informal
relationship with you, whether it is work-related, familial, romantic,
or platonic. </p>
<p>- It's fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.</p>
<p>Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of
interest, only that one exists. Other work group members should not ask
why the person has a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the
discussion of the incident, and recuse themselves from voting on a
response to the report.</p>
<p>4. Call a meeting of the grievance work group.</p>
<p>The committee members without a conflict of interest are the members
of the grievance work group. A member from the grievance work group will
volunteer to be the main facilitator of the report process. A deputy
will also be nominated, and will manage the report process if the
primary faciliator is unable to. The main facilitator will call a
meeting within one month of receiving the report.</p>
<p>5. Review the report.</p>
<p>First the report will be evaluated on <strong>jurisdiction</strong>,
which is whether the report is within the scope of our grievance policy,
and should be further considered. If it is within jurisdiction, it will
be evaluated on <strong>impact</strong> and <strong>risk</strong>. The
combined impact and risk will determine the severity of the outcome.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction</p>
<p>- Is this a Code of Conduct violation? Is this behavior on our list
of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline inappropriate behavior? Does
it violate our community norms? If the answer to any of these questions
is yes, then the report is a Code of Conduct violation.</p>
<p>- Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's
scope? Did this occur at one of our in-person or online events,
associated social events, or on one of our discussion platforms? If the
incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's mental
health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is
taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations within our
community spaces are also in scope.</p>
<p>Impact</p>
<p>- Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public
space? Incidents that all community members can see will have more
negative impact.</p>
<p>- Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our
community? Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our
community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported
person's behavior? Are members of the marginalized group likely to
disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?</p>
<p>- Does this incident involve a community leader? Community members
often look up to community leaders to set the standard of acceptable
behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong></p>
<p>- Does this incident include sexual harassment?</p>
<p>- Does this pose a safety risk? Does the behavior put a person's
physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact
someone's mental health?</p>
<p>- Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated? Does the reported
person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an
established pattern of behavior from past reports?</p>
<p>Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more
severe consequences than reports which involve lower risk or lower
impact.</p>
<p>6. Propose an expected change of behavior</p>
<p>The work group will determine a concrete behavioral modification plan
that ensures the inappropriate behavior is not repeated. The work group
will also discuss what actions may need to be taken if the reported
person does not agree to the behavioral modification plan.</p>
<p>What follows are examples of possible behavioral modification plans
for incidents that occur in community spaces under the scope of this
Code of Conduct. This behavioral modification list is not exhaustive,
and the CCB work group reserves the right to take any action it deems
necessary.</p>
<p>- Requiring that the reported person not use specific language</p>
<p>- Requiring that the reported person not send private messages to a
community member</p>
<p>- Requiring that the reported person not join specific communication
channels</p>
<p>- Removing the reported person from administrator or moderator rights
to community infrastructure</p>
<p>- Removing a volunteer from their duties and responsibilities</p>
<p>- Removing a person from leadership</p>
<p>7. Propose consequences</p>
<p>What follows are examples of possible consequences to an incident
report. This consequences list is not exhaustive, and the CCB Code of
Conduct work group reserves the right to take any action it deems
necessary.</p>
<p>Possible responses to an incident include:</p>
<p>- Nothing, if the behavior was determined to not be a Code of Conduct
violation</p>
<p>- A verbal or emailed warning including a description of the expected
change of behavior and consequences for non compliance.</p>
<p>- A final warning</p>
<p>- Temporarily removing the reported person from the online community
and/or temporarily banning the reported person from in-person events. A
temporary ban may include conditions for re-entry in the community, like
demonstrating an understanding of the harmful behavior and a commitment
to change.</p>
<p>- Permanently removing the reported person from the online community
and/or permanently banning the reported person from in-person events</p>
<p>- Publishing an account of the incident</p>
<p>8. Work group vote</p>
<p>Some work group members may have a conflict of interest and may be
excluded from discussions of a particular incident report. Excluding
those members, decisions on the behavioral modification plans and
consequences will be determined by a majority vote of the CCB Code of
Conduct work group.</p>
<p>9. Follow up with the reported person(s)</p>
<p>The CCB Code of Conduct work group will draft a response to the
reported person(s). The email should contain:</p>
<p>- A description of the person's past behavior in neutral language</p>
<p>- The negative impact of that behavior</p>
<p>- A concrete behavioral modification plan that includes the potential
consequences of their subsequent behavior</p>
<p>- If applicable, offer resources to help the behavior change. </p>
<p>- Mention that a final warning will be sent before more permanent
measures are taken.</p>
<p>The work group should not state who reported this incident. They
should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report.
The reported person(s) should be discouraged from contacting the
reporter to discuss the report. If they wish to apologize to the
reporter, the work group can accept the apology on behalf of the
reporter.</p>
<p>10. Process any responses from reported person(s)</p>
<p>If the reported person(s) provides additional context, the CCB Code
of Conduct work group may need to re-evaluate the behavioral
modification plan and consequences.</p>
<p>11. Follow up with the reporter</p>
<p>A person who makes a report should receive a follow up email stating
what action was taken in response to the report. Communications between
the reported person and the grievance work group will not be shared with
the reporter. If the work group decided no response was needed, they
should provide an email explaining why it was not a Code of Conduct
violation. Reports that are not made in good faith (such as "reverse
sexism" or "reverse racism") may receive no response.</p>
<p>The follow up email should be sent no later than six weeks after the
receipt of the report. If deliberation or follow up with the reported
person takes longer than six weeks, the work group should send a status
email to the reporter.</p>
<p>12. Release a public report if the incident was public</p>
<p>Incidents that happened privately or between a small group will be
documented internally. In case of public incidents, a public report may
be issued.</p>

<p>Where did the proposed grievance policy come from?</p>
<p>Chapter 3 of "How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports" guided the
policy, but we found the Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct
Working Group Enforcement Procedures (<a
href="https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/enforcement/"><em>https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/enforcement/</em></a>)
to be just the right level of detail and efficiency of words. Where it
did not have much detail on was how to collect information for
evaluation, which was provided in </p>
<p>Geek Feminism, Conference anti-harassment/Responding to reports
<em>(</em><a
href="https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports"><em>https://geekfeminism.fandom.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports</em></a><em>).</em></p>
<p>So we've combined these two sources into one policy, and have edited
the text in light of our small size, and the fact that we are all
volunteers, and that we want our commitment in the community to be
sustainable.</p>
