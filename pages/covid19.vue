    Hello everyone,<br /><br />Co.Up—the usual venue for our meet-ups—has
    announced they will be temporarily closing the space at least through April
    13th. We support their decision and we will not be looking for an
    alternative venue and we are suspending our meet-ups until further notice.
    We are exploring online alternatives. We will keep you posted via our usual
    channels (see further down).<br /><br />The advice of Berlin Public Medical
    Officer is to limit all social contact, and even though events of our size
    are not officially banned, we believe this is the only responsible course of
    action to help slow down the spread of the virus, lessen the strain on our
    healthcare system, and protect vulnerable members of our community at
    large.<br /><br />We will post about eventual online events, and let you
    know when physical events resume on our Twitter account, Mattermost chat,
    and Newsletter.<br /><br />Stay safe, stay strong, wash your hands, call
    your loved ones ❤️<br />– The Creative Code Berlin Team<br /><br />Read
